This project uses a custom-built configuration file manager `hm` that's currently not publicly available.

## Using this config

To use this config you have to:

1. Install [`hm`](https://github.com/blanktiger/hm)
2. Clone this repo to `~/.config`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/blanktiger/homecfg ~/.config/homecfg
```
3. Deploy dotfiles either in `copy` mode by doing `hm` or in `symlink` mode by doing `hm --dev`
4. Optionally to install dependencies as per the `INSTALL` instructions, do `hm install`
